<h3>More disturbing tales from horror author B. T Milton!</h3>




<div id="summary">
<div id="blurb">




<h2 id="hblurb">In a certain town on the eastern seaboard...</h2>
<p id="blurb1"> ...they've just built a new megamart. The city council has approved a budget increase for the middle school. The community swimming pool is finally being renovated.
<br><br>
And they've got the house on Glendale Street.<br><br>
Everyone knows to just stay away from that house on Glendale Street. The mailman shreds the mail that comes in for it. The cars don't slow down. The people cross the street instead of walk in front of it. Even the squirrels stay off that perfectly sheared lawn.
<br><br>
But staying away isn't enough anymore. Suddenly people are disappearing and strange things are happening. Highway exits are disappearing. The inter-county train no longer passes through town. The lake has stretched to oceanic proportions with no neighboring towns or shore in sight.  Whatever is in that house on Glendale Street wants something badly, and it&#39;s going to get it by any means necessary.
A chilling tale of small town suburbia gone wrong.

	...we don&#39;t talk about it anymore either, and we pretend not to notice how the chick yellow paint on the vinyl siding never fades, or how the windows are always clear, but shuttered by the inner curtains, and how there are never any excess leaves caught in the gutters or swirling around the porch.

we pretend that no one lives there, yes. we pretend it&#39;s got nothing to do with us."<br><br>
